reason. This product is described as 5W, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly 5V (4.8V, what's the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Watts (5W). Why the mystery, guys Also, this deal is for US 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charger was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charger was also universal. What are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn't understandFor those who don't understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need. As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A. It's perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Amps. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap. Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide. It won't necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended.","1":"3\/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose.","2":"Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible","3":"Burnt up a copper string light I have been using for a years. Short life on other electronics compared to Duracell. Left in a wii controller for 2 months and leaked all over.","4":"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it.","5":"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer.","6":"Bad shelf life. No where near Duracell. For very light duty only.","7":"Go with a brand name.","8":"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better.","9":"Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remotes in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices.","10":"OK for AAA needs","11":"The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.","12":"not as good as the higher quality batteries would not buy again","13":"As advertised, I have not had any problems.","14":"Batteries","15":"Dammit, I ordered these by accident. Was supposed to order AA's, FML.","16":"These seem to be normal AAA batteries. can't comment yet on life expectancy but for the price they could stand to be near the bottom performance and still be an okay value.","17":"They work great!","18":"Usually I buy bricks of batteries from Fry's Electronics, but I had an Amazon gift card, so I figured I would give them a shot and they make my devices work!","19":"Works as expected.","20":"i love it","21":"A ton of batteries for cheap. They are working great so far in my wireless Xbox controller that I use for my PC.","22":"A+A+A+A+A+ FAST DELIVERY JUST AS DESCRIBE","23":"Always looking for AA batteries, controllers for Xbox seem to need a lot of batteries. Nice packaging, too.","24":"Amazing!","25":"Amazingly fast delivery! Item workers well!","26":"Any parent of toddlers knows that there are numerous toys that require AAA batteries.

Gotta have them","32":"Best Battery Deal! They last as long as Duracell and Energizer!","33":"Better in my opinion than energizer and same as Duracell","34":"Bye bye big name, expensive batteries!! Holy moly! I never knew that Amazon sold batteries. In all the years I've been shopping here! I came across these while searching for batteries to use with my son's toys (they all take a ton) as well as for use in products around the house. I took a look at the reviews and decided they were definitely worth trying out! Of course I used my Prime shipping and they arrived in 2 days. Once they arrived we put 3 in my son's toy train and BAM! off it took with speed! Even my son said wow, the train is going faster than ever haha! I'm currently using these in his toys, the wall clock, the meat thermometer and many other items! I certainly recommend these batteries. They came packaged nicely in groups of 4, tucked into a cute little cardboard box. At a fraction of the cost of the big name batteries and they work JUST AS WELL if not BETTER!","35":"Came as expected","36":"Excellent","37":"Excellent","38":"Excellent - not sure why I would ever pay more for batteries.","39":"Fantastic Price on a Great Quality Battery..!

I will buy batteries exclusively from Amazon from now on.It can change from time to time, but mine are made in Thailand.","63":"Have used about half of these now with no issues. They seem to last as long as the name brands and in this house double AA are always needed.","64":"I think this is a great price for 48 batteries. If you are anything like me, i have never have batteries when I need them! Usually its the remote control, and I either borrow batteries from a different device, or switch the batteries around in the remote(which I may add does work very short term, but it does work!) When I saw these on Amazon I couldn't pass them up. We bought these in October, which was super helpful around Christmas. They come in a nice sturdy box, which is where I store them. They are packages in groups of four. They have lasted a while, and I have had no issues.I paid around 11 then and I just noticed that they are slightly cheaper with Subscribe and Save so needless to say I will be picking up another box. Great Batteries!","65":"Incredible deal for this prices, the batteries are long duration nice!","66":"It is the first time I purchased Amazon Basic AA Alkaline batteries and I am glad I did. It is a solid performer at reasonable price.. Will buy more in the future for sure!","67":"Item as advertised!!!!","68":"Last forever-great buy.","69":"Last longer than name brands.","70":"Long lasting batteries for my deer cam, compare to name brand batteries for way less money.","71":"Love the AmazonBasics AA Batteries. Also bought the AmazonBasics D Cell batteries previously. Getting just as good life out of them, if not better, than the two major name brand batteries. Highly recommend these batteries either in AA or D cell. Will buy again....","72":"No more going to the store for batteries for me. So far they have been working fine.","73":"Overall, happy with the product. They work well.","74":"Packaged nicely in four packs and within a sturdy cardboard box. They work great!","75":"Price and reviews were pretty good, only time will tell...","76":"Product came on time. No complaints.","77":"Product seems to be as advertised.","78":"Product was as pictured online. Product did meet my expectations. Would purchase from this seller again.","79":"Put 18 of the batteries in devices already and they all work. Fast delivery no issues","80":"Quality batteries.","81":"Simple review here, because...they are batteries. Use these all the time and they are great!","82":"So far so good.","83":"The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.","84":"The most batteries for the lowest price. I have not comprehensively tested these for longevity, but like the ferocious Zerg, their sheer numbers can dominate other units.","85":"These are batteries. So far they're working well.","86":"These batteries are great! They work well and last really long. I figured these batteries would be a complete dud, but that's definitely not the case. Highly recommend!","87":"These batteries last as long as many of the name brands. They are packaged in sets of 4 in a sturdy box, and the individual packages are easy to open. No complaints in regards to price and longevity of use as I'm getting the same amount of use out of things like my battery operated mouse as I would with a name brand.","88":"These batteries last as long if not longer than the top name brand.","89":"These were purchased to add to our many battery operated Christmas decorations. They continue to perform as advertised.","90":"These work very well and are priced well. Just as good as Duracell or Everteady or other major brands.","91":"These work well in heavy duty use, I use them for my bicycle lights","92":"They are Super , had them in my outdoor weather station sensors for 10 months and in with all types of weather conditions and they are still working !!!!!!!!!","93":"They are great, and great value. I buy them every year for my Christmas needs.","94":"They work.","95":"This box of batteries was a great value. Better than buying from the other box stores. I like how they came in an easy to open cardboard box. Each set of 4 inside the box is wrapped in a thin layer of plastic so the batteries don't roll around and make a mess. I used these to replenish all my kids' talking\/lightup toys...as those toys don't generally work well with rechargables. I'm going to buy more of these as needed!","96":"This is a great purchase! I recommend it to anyone who isn't looking to spend the same amount for like 6 batteries. This is bundle is a great deal. The batteries last for a long time!!","97":"This is not 39in long","98":"This is the best deal on batteries around! They work very well! I replaced the batteries in all my kids' toys.","99":"Very good!","100":"Very happy with them. Work as well as name brand ones that are twice the price.","101":"Very nice packaging! Love the price and the nice convenient packaging makes it easy to store, find and keep track of the batteries. Great job Amazon!","102":"Very nice product and I'm very happy with it. My experience with this seller was excellent. I would not hesitate to deal with them again.","103":"Who doesn't need batteries","104":"Will buy again. I used to buy the coppertop","105":"Work great","106":"Work well","107":"Works as expected. Good value","108":"Works good for kids toys","109":"Works just as good as other name brand batteries. I can't speak for longevity as these are used in devices that either gets used a lot or sometimes not for a week at a time. So far I would buy again.","110":"as expected","111":"excellent","112":"good value","113":"great","114":"great buy","115":"great deal","116":"great product","117":"great value","118":"love","119":"perfect","120":"perfect and the price was excellent.","121":"so far so good!","122":"works for the office","123":"This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone.","124":"A very good document storage grat","125":"I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully. It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens.","126":"Very well constructed and reasonably priced.","127":"fab case for any laptop would buy another again i got it for my laptop and it is fine and strong plenty of pockets","128":"Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.","129":"Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected.","130":"I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.","131":"These things are cool! With the new muti room music options I can have the same song playing in each room. Not to mention the intercom! Great item!","132":"We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.","133":"Best purchase made. Best thing I like is that its portable and the battery life is very reasonable. Another practical idea is when there a group of wanting to talk to a family member that couldnt make to a family gathering, we sit around the table, Set the TAP in the middle and we can all have a conversation, at night I can have Alexa play some easy listening music after a hectic day.","134":"The only thing we don't like is that it had to stay plugged in to work.","135":"Great speaker. Love how its portable. Good battery life. Would be 5 stars if it had the drop in capabilities like the rest of the echo family.","136":"I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!","137":"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good.","138":"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time.","139":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.She loves it, easy to use, speakers are more clear than her other devices Great volume","140":"If you dont need the voice activation of Alexa, or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you, consider the Tap. Almost all of the functionality of Alexa, but in a smaller ( and less expensive ) version.Great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives.","141":"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!","142":"My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.","143":"Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal","144":"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.","145":"This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button","146":"easy to use , sound is great, i use it any where in the house","147":"I wanted to get a portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use while out as well as at home. The tap has great sound quality and Alexa is more useful than I would have thought.","148":"The Kindle Voyage is definitely the way to go. I bought this Kindle to replace my 1st generation Kindle because I wanted a more compact model and the 3G capability this one offers. I am definitely a fan!","149":"I love this e-reader. My other reader was not backlit so needed something I could use in low light. This works perfectly for reading at night and in the sun. The light is adjustable. Love downloading books from the library. It has a 3G connection which I have not used yet, so far used only in wi-fi areas.","150":"I've had a Kindle since they first came out and was happy to get one with a backlit screen. I like the WiFi and the 3G because I like the freedom of downloading books and newspapers while in the car, at the beach, by the pool when another guest recommends a new book. I still haven,t figured out some of the buttons, and because it is smaller I am always turning the page. I have adjusted the font and how far apart the lines are, but it still seems like I'm doing more page turning.","151":"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long.","152":"I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.","153":"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games\/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible.","154":"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80","155":"it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad","156":"Bought for my kid - 5 year old Kid. Worth a buy. Recommended.","157":"Great product and lightweight. Battery keeps its charge. Would recommend this product to another young person","158":"He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics","159":"I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February\/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.","160":"The idea is great, a kindle just for kids. Design just for them with pre-approved content.The price was great. I got it for $79.99 on black friday. Plus, it has a 2 year full replacement warranty. They break it, we fix it. Is that simple.Content, wow tons of apps, interactive books and videos.User Interface, not the best one. Amazon should create a computer base aplication to enable and edit all content.","161":"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100","162":"A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use!","163":"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year.","164":"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year.","165":"Bought this for our grandson, we originally had the Nabi Dreamtab, (by the way I have purchased 3 of them !!) This definitely beats that by a long shot. Very good tablet for kids !!","166":"Easy setup...bought this for 2 grandchildren under 5...they love it","167":"Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well. Don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. He understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day.","168":"Great gift for a child that loves tech and loves to put apps on your phone.","169":"Great tablet for my son. Kid applications are very useful in his learning.","170":"Great tablet for my three year old son It's really easy for him to use","171":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7yr old granddaughter and it's very easy for her to use.","172":"I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and now thinks its great since she has her own computer she says.","173":"Internet usage is restricted. I returned it for a regular Kindle Fire and bought the kids case and Geek Squad protection plan instead.","174":"Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it","175":"Love this tablet! It's easy to setup and the pre-loaded games were a hit with my little one! Very pleased with the the selection of videos and games on Amazon Kid Play :)","176":"My 2 yr old loves his tablet. Best purchase ever. It has great educational videos and is easy for him to work on his kids profile. Amazon got it right!","177":"My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome","178":"My grandbaby loves hers. We gave it as a Christmas present!","179":"My son is obsessed with his kids kindle!! A must have so they stay off your phone !","180":"My son loves everything about it the songs the games and music videos","181":"Protective, fast and has tons of fun games already on it! Our 7 year old daughter likes it, too!","182":"Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty.","183":"This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.","184":"This product is a perfect learning tool for my daughter","185":"We recently purchased this exact tablet for our daughter who is 2 years old and decided to purchase this tablet for a charitable gift at Christmas. I would recommend this rather than more expensive tablet options for a child. it is worth the money and very user friendly.","186":"Works great and have not had any issues. The case is great for younger kids","187":"Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote.","188":"Batteries arrived drained. all of them.","189":"I don't know who made these batteries but they are worthless. They do not hold a charge.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.","190":"I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.","191":"I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. My experience has been poor. I put a pair in the sensor for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I've had way better success with rechargeable.","192":"I would give it zero stars if possible. Every single battery came dead. Every. Single. One. Completely useless and a waste of time to try and fight for a refund. Usually I have great faith in AmazonBasics, but now I'm not so sure.","193":"Put these batteries in led string lights on two wreaths, place kirkland batteries in another set of the same lights....guess what Amazon batteries loose their power quickly. Kirkland batteries are still flashing strong,,,,,,Amazon batteries barely blink. Sorry Amazon, love you but not these for me.","194":"These are horrible! Don't waste your money. These batteries die faster than any I've ever tried. A few hours in a Wii remote and they have to be replaced. I'm so disappointed!","195":"These batteries only last 2-3 days in my tv remote","196":"Utterly worthless, no staying power.","197":"Very weak batteries","198":"When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen.","199":"purchased in sept 2015 went to change because light was not working . batteries leaked and ruined a special optical light . now checking all other light they are in .","200":"these are junk. you get a large quantity but they are not long-lasting and sometimes need to be changed after only a few hours of continuous use.i do not recommend these and will not purchase them again.","201":"Batteries just don't have the strength or long run time. Read all the possitive and negative comments before I bought and they are true.These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly, will come back with a rest but drain faster each time. Dont use in equipment that have a heavy demand. Clocks would be ok. Expect 1\/2 the performance of the leading brands.","202":"Half the batteries didn't work!","203":"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again.","204":"Not very long lasting batteries....","205":"Seems like these don't last long at all","206":"The original Amazon Basics in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use.","207":"Don't hold a charge as long as other comparable batteries","208":"Haven't use the batteries at this time and expect 5 star performance.","209":"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock.","210":"Not as strong and not lasting long enough as the major brands.","211":"Not quite the performance I would expect from a product that Amazon puts it's name on. A bit dissapointed.","212":"They don't really last to long. But for the price....","213":"ok for the price","214":"Can't go wrong with AmazonBasics batteries - quality at a great value.","215":"Decent quality. Of course Great seller )","216":"Good Product.","217":"Good batteries.","218":"Great long lasting battery","219":"Great product. I always keep them handy to use on kids gaming controls and other miscellaneous items around the house.","220":"Great value","221":"I purchased these AmazonBasics batteries because I used a lot of batteries around the house and I was looking for the best value. I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries. Compared to the Rayovac brand, which I have been using exclusively before purchasing these, I would say the AmazonBasics batteries give you just a bit less life. They do store well and perform well in most electronics that I've tested thus far.","222":"I'm impressed worth the life of these batteries, still going strong after printing 3 cartridges worth of labels on my dymo labeler.","223":"One of the best deals on batteries Ive ever gotten. I feel like they are just about as good as Duracell or Energizer but for this price you cant deny the value. Ill be buying Amazon batteries in bulk like this from now on. It's close enough to the major brands for me to switch and enjoy the value.","224":"Seems decent as far as life of the batteries. Good enough to stock up on these for emergencies.","225":"Seems to work just as well as other batteries. Good for using in toys. No complaints.","226":"These night lights are worthless. They do not work as described on Amazon.","227":"They die a little faster than expected but hey their batteries when you need them","228":"They work as expected. They last at least as long as other brands and are less expensive.","229":"They work fine. Not the longest lasting battery but dollar for dollar they do just fine","230":"They work well for the price","231":"We got these for our TV remote. We didn't need such a large package, but it was the cheapest option, so we went ahead and purchased the 20 pack. It was great to be able to save money over the name brands, and since it was Amazon brand, we figured they would be good quality (and we were right). It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great. Probably won't run out of AAA anytime soon, but would consider buying other sizes when needed.","232":"does what batteries should do","233":"good","234":"good batteries for the price. great for remotes and clocks, last a little less in cameras. still a great value for the price!","235":"great batteries works extremely well and we put it on our smoke detectors have to change them once a monthwill buy again","236":"trying them out. so far so good","237":"AA batteries are replacements and have worked well so far","238":"Amazing price for all of these batteries!","239":"Appear to be of good quality and are plenty bright, and hold their power well.","240":"Arrived quickly. Can't beat the price.","241":"As stated","242":"Awesome","243":"Awesome buy. Very happy with these. This is my second order of these batteries. Will continue to purchase when needed.","244":"Awesome price, awesome batteries. I will never buy batteries anywhere else again, this deal is hard to beat.","245":"Batteries are perfect","246":"Batteries come in small boxes of their own which makes it easier to organize and store. Love it !!","247":"Batteries were cheap and work just as good as other name brands. I will only buy these from now on for most of my electronics.","248":"Battery good life span","249":"Battery life lasting much longer than expected.","250":"Best Product Value , Amazon know what they doing (:Good price for quantity , for sure will buy more .","251":"Best bargain in batteries I've found yet!","252":"Best deal in town.","253":"Bought these for a couple of baby toys, and so far, they have worked great. They are much cheaper compared to other popular brands!","254":"Came as advertised. Batteries seem to last pretty long and the price was great. Even the paging they sent it in was greatPlease Vote YES on my review!! Thank you","255":"Can't beat the price, no issues with longevity.","256":"Cheap quick and easy. Best battery bundle.","257":"Cheep and effective these batteries compare to mainstream manufacturers without issue. The price tag is so much lower that even if you didn't like them or felt that a major manufacturer was somehow better than this you probably still wouldn't regret the purchase. They hold their charge and last just as long as anything else. Amazon Strikes again with a great product","258":"Decent batteries...gets the job done.","259":"Decent price for the grand kid's toys. Last a good time.","260":"Does the job. Very good price!","261":"Excellent","262":"Excellent batteries with a long shelf-life.","263":"Excellent batteries! Last just as long if not longer than the name brands. These are what I'll be purchasing from now on.","264":"Excellent value for the money.","265":"Excellent value, and the batteries last just as long as other brands. Thank you Amazon!","266":"For this price I cant believe how many I get! And they last forever!!","267":"Good","268":"Good Batteries","269":"Good and cheap.","270":"Good batteries and a fantastic price.","271":"Good batteries, what else is there to say","272":"Good deal.","273":"Good packaging and batteries seem to last as long as other brands. Definitely would purchase again!","274":"Good price and good product.","275":"Good product","276":"Good product at great price!!","277":"Good quality","278":"Goodbye brand name batteries, these are great!","279":"Great Product","280":"Great batteries at an incredible price! They don't work like discount batteries and I will now be ordering my batteries from Amazon in the future.","281":"Great batteries for a great price","282":"Great batteries my kids use them a lot for I don't know. But I have use them they seem to last as long as the name brand I have no complaints. I havent had one leak yet very good product.","283":"Great batteries work just as well as other name brands.","284":"Great batteries! They don't quite last as long on electronics as I'd imagined they would, but there is no disappointment compared to the money I was spending on other battery brands. I will be buying these in bulk for the foreseeable future!","285":"Great batteries.","286":"Great buy, a lot of batteries for the price, no issues with dead or weak batteries.","287":"Great deal, they last pretty long","288":"Great package.","289":"Great price and great performance. I loaded 10 of these batteries into my Field Camera 6 months ago and the camera is still taking pictures.","290":"Great price for alkaline batteries. They seem to work as well as any other batteries I've purchased. We use a lot of batteries around here and if I can save a little money and still get a great price, why not Thanks Amazon for a great product.","291":"Great product and you can't beat the price.","292":"Great product!","293":"Great value and holds up just as well, ifnnot better than name brand! Our household has switch to amazon basic as our new household brand for batteries.","294":"Great value batteries.","295":"Great value.","296":"Great value.","297":"Great! Now always have some when Grandkids come from out of state.","298":"Great, long lasting batteries. I got them for my game camera, and after two months of use, they're still going strong on the first set.","299":"High quality, long lasting, fast delivery. And a great price. Can't beat that! I recommend buying in bulk.","300":"Hold's a charge nice. I will buy these again.","301":"I am constantly pleased with the Amazon Basics branded products. Both the quality of the product packaging keep me purchasing them over other brands.I will continue to buy Amazon Basics!","302":"I believe this one is more better than Duracell. Will buy again .","303":"I bought the 48 pack to get the best price on each battery. Great deal.","304":"I bought these after reading the reviews. They came nicely packaged. No issues so far with the things we have been using them for (toys, remotes). Will update if we have any issues.","305":"I don't think I can find cheaper Alkaline batteries to be honest. Their life is pretty good too.","306":"I seriously don't think I will buy these from the store ever again. These are half the price, and work well in all of my electronics.","307":"I thought this was a great deal for batteries. I bought these for my computer wireless mouse at work and home. I always leave my mouse on and I know I shouldn't, I just forget!These are great and have lasted longer than I have thought. I've only used two out of my pack since buying this.","308":"I used to buy bulk energizer batteries at the club stores but these are cheaper, delivered to my home, and work just as well. Will definitely continue to purchase.","309":"I was previously buying batteries at dollar tree, 4 at time. This will not only save me time, but money and they're great quality for the price! As soon as I opened, I put them to use for my Xbox one wireless controller to try them out and they have lasted much longer than the batteries I was using before.","310":"I'm very happy with these batteries. Cheaper than a local deal at a hardware store. They seem to work as well as the name brands. I'm happy with the quality and quantity.","311":"Its a battery and it works","312":"Just what I wanted. Last long enough to consider it as my preferred AAA batteries.","313":"Lasts just as long as Duracell.","314":"Literally. Bought these in May and they JUST ran out. These are great batteries (F the specs, I'll leave that to battery specialists. But these lasted way longer and better than a Plug and Play. Minus the cord when the battery died. Bought these again. Can't beat the price of effectiveness.","315":"Look its an established fact of life that if you are going to live life in the world of the living at some point you will need to buy batteries. You can purchase expensive ones that have slick tv ads or you can purchase dead duds at the .99 cent stores or you can achieve a happy medium and purchase them through Amazon. At this price point, this many batteries is a great deal.","316":"Lots of fresh batteries at a great price.","317":"Love Amazon batteries, great price and last pretty long","318":"Love buying these batteries bc I use a lot of need","319":"My neighbor gave me several of these to use when I was out of AA and needed some ASAP. These are just as good as the name brands alkaline batteries and absolutely no leaks of any kind including the pair I had outside last winter in the LED light. That is why I reordered a couple different times using AmazonBasics for AA and AAA. Recommended highly and easy to order and priced just right!","320":"Never enough of these in the house. I really like the bulk purchase and have them handy option.","321":"Nice product for a good price.","322":"Nice quality, lasted a while, and there were tons of them!","323":"No complaints, so far the batteries are lasting as they should for batteries of this size.","324":"No problem with these.","325":"Not so surprised as AmazonBasics delivers excellent product. Work just like the Energizers and last as long.","326":"Once again...Amazon delivers! I use a ton of these batteries I even tried the route of buying info on how to recharge unrechargables...but in the long run it was a big pain in the you know where so I bought these! I'm happy! Thank you!","327":"Pleased with the performance of these batteries.","328":"Product arrived on time. Good batteries.","329":"Purchased at a decent price and haven't noticed any difference from any other batteries I have used. Long as you can get them at a decent price I'd definitely recommend.","330":"Really good .sending to me just 1day .and really much stuff for this price.","331":"So far so good, will keep buying Amazon Basics batteries.","332":"So far they seem as good as the major brands. Second time have ordered and have had no issues with the quality versus the name brands.","333":"So far. So good. Appears to perform as well as the national brands.","334":"The batteries are great quality.What I liked the best about it is the was its packaged! It comes in a card box that can be open\/closed and in it the batteries are packaged with a wrapper in a group of 4. Absolutely brilliant!No more loose batteries that you have to guess if they are old or new!!!Goodbye durable... Hello amazon basics!","335":"These are decent but I find they last about 20 less than Duracell batteries, but considering the cost difference they are actually worth it.","336":"These are great batteries, at a great deal. They last a long time and we are very happy with the purchase. We did however have some that are DOA, I called Amazon and they took care of us, AWESOME customer service, as always.","337":"These are great! They come in a frustration free box that is great for storing them. For the price, they work well for me. I use these for a LED motion sensor light that I use in my bathroom.","338":"These are just as good as any other battery as far as I can tell but cost far less. Great option if you use lots of batteries! Tired of the store ripping me off when I need a couple.","339":"These batteries are amazing! They are reasonably priced and come packaged in groups of four. My husband has to use batteries out in the field (Military) and he says as long as Amazon sells these and keeps the packaging the same, we will always purchase from them. They last just as long as Duracell and Energizer with the equipment that he uses and since they are packaged in groups of four, it is easier to store them in his pack and not worry about the batteries bursting and leaking into the pack.","340":"These batteries are great for the price. Being as affordable as they are, I was expecting them to not last long or work well. They proved me wrong and these are honestly the best batteries I have used. I've been using them for almost 8 months now and haven't had to replace any. Granted, I don't have them in anything that uses a ton of battery power, but for the price they're worth it even lasting this long. I have them in remotes and some lights and no problems!I also love being able to buy in large packs, as then I don't have to worry about getting more batteries for a long time.It's nice to be able to stock up at a super affordable price.","341":"These batteries dont quite hold up to the same time and durability of Duracell or other name brand but they are a great alternatives! More than worth the price.","342":"These batteries seem as long lasting as a certain copper topped variety I have used in the past. Maybe longer lasting. Regardless, they came to my door quickly when I needed them.","343":"These batteries work just as well as the name brand batteries and they last just as long at a much better price point. I purchased these for the company, but I was so impressed with them that I purchased these batteries in AAA, AA and D on my personal Amazon account for home use and paid the same for a bulk package of 48 as I would have for an 8 pack of name brand batteries. They come in a sturdy cardboard box that comes in handy for neatly storing them. Amazon also printed the size of the batteries on the side of the box, making it easy to just grab the ones you need. Never again will we be asking each other if we have any (insert size) batteries and if so, where are they...or even worse, having to borrow a battery from one device to work another!","344":"These seem to last as long as any named brand battery. I'm not sure what will happen with corrosion in the long term storage items - I'll post more if they show corrosion issues.","345":"These work as well as any big name brand batteries. I'm a heavy pc user since I work from home and I use a wireless mouse with my laptop. I can get weeks of use out of these without an issue. And even when the low battery light starts flashing on the mouse, I still get 2-3 days use out of them. Save your money, and buy these instead.","346":"These work perfectly in every application I've needed them for. They have so far lasted just as long as the copper tops I usually buy at a significant price savings.","347":"They are batteries. They work. Price is good. Haha not much else to say!","348":"They don't last quite as long as regular batteries but long enough to still save money. I'm pleased with these batteries.","349":"They provide a good level of power and fit in battery compartments that are designed for AAA batteries. What more can you ask for.","350":"They work great, they're an amazing price and it's wonderful to order them in bulk - so we always have them on hand when needed. A great subscribe save item. Love this product from Amazon!","351":"They work well and they are a great price!","352":"They worked as expected. No complaints","353":"This is the first time I buy amazon batteries. Was a little skeptical at first, but this batteries work as good as the major brands. Very happy with the purchase.","354":"Triple A batteries , not much to say other than I was happy with the convenience that Amazon offers. No issues and am happy with my purchase","355":"Very Good item.","356":"Very good batteries for price than major competing brands.","357":"Very good quality item. A+++","358":"Very pleased.","359":"Well packaged and long lasting.","360":"What a great price. Love having extra batteries around the house at Christmas time.","361":"When local stores don't have special on alkaline batteries, it's hard to beat the price of the AmazonBasics packs. They perform just as well as the major brands. It's nice to have a few on hand for replacing batteries in remotes, thermometers, etc.","362":"Wonderful staple to have in your home. My go to battery source.","363":"Work as advertised","364":"Work great","365":"Work just as good as name brand!!","366":"Work.","367":"Worked good for less than 2 weeks then the buttons became non responsive","368":"Works as good as other batteries","369":"Works as intended lol","370":"Yay! The best price and great quality","371":"You can't beat the price and quality. We go through a lot of batteries and these hold up just as well or better than any of the major brands that we have in any of our controllers, flash lights, remotes, etc. We haven't bought any other brand since buying these.","372":"You can't beat these batteries for the price! I'm very pleased with them they last as long as top name brands but for much cheaper I will buy more for sure","373":"You know those crazy cheap batteries that are so light you practically hit yourself in the face when you pick one up These aren't those.I've already purchased a couple sets of these and have been really happy with the quality\/lifespan. I'd say they're DEFINTELY comparable to the more expensive name brands. I've happily recommended them to friends and family, and it's so handy always having plenty of AA batteries, especially around birthdays and holidays!","374":"as advertised","375":"as expeted","376":"batteries what can you say","377":"cheap and does the job.","378":"excellent","379":"good","380":"good buy","381":"good power","382":"good product, good price","383":"good quality!","384":"great batteries and haven't had any leak yet like other off price or off brand ones.","385":"great find great buy for all batteries","386":"great price","387":"great price for so many batteries good quality","388":"great product!","389":"great quality, price and convenient to have available at all times","390":"keeps my electronics running all through the night. wink wink...","391":"nice quality","392":"no other way to buy batteries","393":"ok","394":"ok","395":"standard alkaline battery ... can't beat the price","396":"they look good and a great value","397":"they work","398":"vary good","399":"very good","400":"when we put them in the appliance they worked properly.","401":"work great in everything.","402":"working perfect","403":"works great","404":"works well","405":"you have kids, teenagers that like toys, remote control cars or anything that require batteries then this is item is for you.. easy to use.. dont think about it just buy it.. : )","406":"Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.","407":"When I first bought it and got it started it wouldn't register my amazon account. I tried making a new account and I tried using my moms account but it would not work so I took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully, haven't had any issues with it yet.","408":"Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera","409":"I bought this tablet for myself because I bought the 8 gb one for my 6 year old and was so impressed with it that I bought myself the 16 gb one","410":"I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.","411":"Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.","412":"i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done","413":"works great, easy to use. play videos and game good","414":"Bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter. She loved it. Easy to use and excellent display. I am considering one for myself now that I've seen and used hers. Very light also.","415":"Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device.","416":"Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.","417":"Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced","418":"Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.","419":"I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.","420":"I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it","421":"IT was just as described. I would recommend it to a friend.","422":"It has been useful for college looking up information I don't understand and for downloading books. It is also great for downloading apps such as Facebook, messageer, yahoo, google, Google maps, and the weather. It has also been great for downloading games.","423":"It has everything he needs. He is using the tablet each day.","424":"Loving my Christmas gift - best gift that I've received in awhile. I love the ease of downloading books and having something new to read at any given time.","425":"My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies.","426":"Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games","427":"Really enjoyed this product, books, music, weather, news at my finger tip. A big part of my life. I use at on the train, on my breaks at work, at home.","428":"This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun","429":"This is my second Kindle Fire and I have been extremely pleased with them both. This second one is much more versatile, and I love it!","430":"This is so awesome, I can check my email when I'm not at home, if the place I'm visiting has WIFI. It also plays games! A true multi-tasker!","431":"This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere.","432":"This tablet is great and easy to use. Very convenient and handy to have around","433":"Works great, makes a great gift! .................","434":"bought this kindle for my grandson, he loves it and it very easy to use","435":"Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........","436":"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies\/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them.","437":"This Amazon Fire is better then I expected. It does exactly what I need it to do. Fits in my bag, very light weight. Love that I can carry so many book on one device.","438":"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing.","439":"I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.","440":"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok","441":"BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.","442":"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue.","443":"Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that","444":"Got this for my grand niece, she loves it. Can't beat it for the price.","445":"Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..","446":"I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.","447":"I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed.","448":"My 2 years old daughter really likes it. It's friendly and easy to use.","449":"Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.","450":"Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!","451":"The tablet has been working fine, I would prefer instructions on the PC to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter (who got the tablet) seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so I am satisfied so far.","452":"This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!","453":"Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps\/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.","454":"great tablet for kids with amazon bonuses. don't have to worry about what content my kid is accessing.","455":"Aiden's is loving his tablet, using educational apps learning his letters and numbers","456":"Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools!","457":"Bought as Christmas gift. She loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty.","458":"Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.","459":"Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it","460":"Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!","461":"Bought this tablet for my 2 &1\/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.","462":"Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself","463":"Easy to use for children. Multiple color tablet covers.","464":"Easy to use, very durable, kid mode extra safe, password needed for purchases and parental mode. All in all a wonderful tablet to own.","465":"Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.","466":"I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google\/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!","467":"I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.","468":"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product.","469":"I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great","470":"I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who just started kindergarten and it is helping her tremendously with her basic skills in counting and reading in English and foreign languages. She also enjoys having the tablet to read stories to her as it lights up the words for her to read along. She loves the ability to watch her favorite programs as well. This was most definitely a worthwhile purchase.","471":"I purchased this tablet for my five year old and he loves IT and so do I. The games and activities are age appropriate. This tablet is such a great buy.","472":"Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games.","473":"My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome","474":"My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe","475":"My daughter loves this tablet hard to get her to put it down. Strong battery and a full tablet for her as she ages","476":"My granddaughter loves this tablet. It's the perfect gift for a 2 year old","477":"My little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. Best Christmas gift ever.","478":"My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present","479":"My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present","480":"My niece is going to love this! Great price and nice color.","481":"My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She","482":"My six year old turned this tablet on immediately on Christmas Day. He knew how to operate it easily.","483":"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!","484":"Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.","485":"The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids.","486":"We bought it for our granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!","487":"What I really like is that you can set up different profiles( boy,girl and myself ) and still you can use any device to play to favorite profile.I bought 2 and kids are very happy.","488":"Where do I begin? It comes with an amazing thick case, it's a fully functioning tablet. It also comes with a one year subscription to educational games and movies\/ shows. If it breaks Amazon replaces! How could you choose any other tablet? This was so great we had to get two!","489":"I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work.","490":"It is a very good E-Reader, battery lasts for weeks.","491":"So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library\/store etc.","492":"I bought this game for my son, and he loves it..it is very entertaining.","493":"Having had several models of Kindle readers, I can say that this is the best yet and is definitely worth the extra cost.","494":"I bought if for my husband for our travel. Much lighter then taking books or ipad with us. Took him a little time to figure out the device and how to borrow e-books from our local public library. But now he loves it.","495":"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.","496":"I had an original kindle that finally gave up the ghost after several years of service. I have been using my iPad mini as a reader, but it bothered my eyes after extended use. I like a dedicated reader like the voyager. It is about as close as you can come to an actual book. Love the adjustable backlot screen.","497":"Reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly","498":"This is my favorite kindle so far. The size is perfect and the weight is minimal. I love the fact it is back lit and I don't need a book light.","499":"This is my second Kindle device. I enjoy using this to read in lower light conditions with the automatic adjustment. Touch screen is nice, but can accidentally move pagesif your fingers slip. No issues with readability in many light conditions.","500":"Bought this reader for a present for my mom. She loves it. Able to take her book with her in a smaller form loves how it looks like paper pages. Easy to order a new book.","501":"Great contrast and battery life with easy user interface.","502":"Lightweight easy read easy page turning self adjusting read light great too.","503":"This is my third Kindle, plus I have used the Kindle app on my two iPads and three iPhones. I always want to have a real Kindle so I will read in peace and avoid distraction from email, texts and such.This is much more readable that all of the previous models. The resolution is as good as I could ever want. The lighting is perfectly even and makes reading in any light (or lack of) completely comfortable. The screen response is almost perfect, but I am just getting use to the new side areas to turn pages. I love the weight and can read in any position, including on my back in bed, with one hand.I am perfectly fine with paying $200 for this Kindle. If you want something to read your books, and nothing else, this is the product for you.","504":"The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.","505":"We had previously owned Kindle paperwhite version 1 and this is a substantial improvement. The new screen is much brighter and the response is quicker .","506":"I like the small, light weight size, and the adaptive lighting. But the page turning is too sensitive, skipping ahead many pages when I am just moving the Kindle, and going back and then forward when I am trying to change just one page.","507":"This is my first kindle. I'm not sure how I lived without one now. The screen is excellent. I love being able to read outside (no glare!!) AND in bed (built in light!). Not sure how useful the automatic light adjuster is but it is a neat idea. Maybe as I use it more I will come to appreciate the automatic light adjustment.","508":"I got the amazon Fire HD 10 for reading and other activities. It was very easy to set up. Netflix worked ok on it. It mostly works well, but there are limitations to the apps that are available. I tried it out for a while and then returned it for a Samsung S2 9.7.","509":"Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it. Easy to use","510":"I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much.","511":"I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad.","512":"Biggest and best Kindle yet. Light as a feather. Buy one today.","513":"Great notepad! Huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use. Love it!","514":"I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product.","515":"I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad.","516":"I love my new Kindle!! I would recommend this to everyone!! It has so many features and love the size!!","517":"Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.","518":"Very happy with my purchase!! I bought this for my Mom and it was easy for her to navigate and she was able to easily download books and games.","519":"Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available","520":"It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot","521":"It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps","522":"I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.","523":"This is a nice little tablet, for me since I don't do a lot on a tablet, it's a great size. It took a little getting use to working with, but am a little more comfortable with it now.","524":"Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!","525":"Bought this tablet for my son..great battery life, shipped fast..great value!","526":"I use this all the time for playing games and reading books, it's great for surfing the web too.","527":"I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.","528":"Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen","529":"It was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time","530":"Killer tablet for the price. No issues running any apps or programs.","531":"My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price.","532":"Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old.","533":"So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.","534":"This Fire worked great but I returned it because it was not the one I wantedBest Buy took it back for a full refund with no problems Best Buy is alsome","535":"Was not hard to set up and love the quality. Good screen size and clarity.","536":"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed.","537":"Enjoy using this product. My granddaughter downloads multiplied games to play and can play them while traveling. Good size and can easily fit into small bag.","538":"Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some.","539":"Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI.","540":"I bought this for my daughter. I like it all in all. I was unaware that it didn't have a google to do internet searching.","541":"I have purchased other tablets such as a kurio for kids and this is by far the best. It has all the apps you need as an adult, great for both adults and kids to read books and great visuals. Only bad thing like my old Kindle fire, the micro-usb portion gets loose.","542":"Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.","543":"We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4\/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.","544":"Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.","545":"Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web.","546":"Easy to use at home or lunch at the office. The only problem I have is that you have to restart often. Great while using public transportation.","547":"I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors!","548":"I bought this for my step mom who likes playing solitaire. She wore her hand held game out and couldn't find a replacement. She just loves it and can do a lot of other things on it.","549":"I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!","550":"I bought this to stream HD music via bluetooth to my stereo. Works great and for the price offered can't be beat.","551":"I had a Kindle Fire and upgraded to the 5th generation. Could not be more pleased with this tablet.","552":"I love this tablet,I use it for school readings ,for my philosophy class , my Mac book is to delicate to take to school,but my fire tablet is perfect !","553":"I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.","554":"I'm very satisfied with my purchase, I made a wise purchase","555":"Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation","556":"Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!","557":"Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...","558":"My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it","559":"Very happy with my purchase. The tablet works amazingly good for the price.","560":"Very pleased with the quality of this tablet and I was fortunate that it was on sale at the time of purchase","561":"We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use","562":"We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us.","563":"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies\/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them.","564":"I love my new Fire tablet. Nice backlight helps me to read my E-book in bed. Background color can be changed. I especially like the black background with white lettering; less glare on my eyes while reading.","565":"This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs.","566":"So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions","567":"Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.","568":"Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!","569":"There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.","570":"I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k","571":"Good tablet durable lots of apps just right for 3 year old","572":"Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.","573":"I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February\/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.","574":"My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose.","575":"My kids enjoy this tablet, as do I! The only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much, even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in be.Also uses a ton of memory, even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken.","576":"My son really enjoys this. Its his first tablet(he is 4) and had no problem learning how to use it.","577":"The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.","578":"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids.","579":"We got this tablet for my son and it has been a great fit. The screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish. Considering the price and that it is intended for children I think it is great.","580":"We purchased Amazon Fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost 2 year old for a 10 hour drive to Florida. Works great and I love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection.","581":"Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service.....","582":"Bought this tablet for my 2 &1\/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.","583":"Great product. As advertised. Very easy to set up profiles with daily goals and limits. Great purchase.","584":"Great-----------------------------------------------","585":"Great.I love it..Im glad I got it..My nephew loves it.","586":"I bought this as a gift for my grandkids. They absolutely love it!","587":"I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. She loves the number of books she is able to access. It wasd a Christmas hit!","588":"I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view.","589":"I researched other tablets before purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition. This tablet is everything I thought it would be and more. Great price too. Lots of available features and apps. Very easy to use. My 2 year old grandson loves it!!! He' s having lots of fun and learning.","590":"It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids","591":"Its a good tablet. Fast, durable and easy to use. I especially love the parental features that are available. I am more of a fan of android tablets but for a little toodler this is far better.","592":"Just purchased as a Christmas gift for my glambaby & she loves it !!!! Very nice case for little clumsy & at times rough hands!!!","593":"Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way, while its kid-proof case prevents easy damage. An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies,","594":"Love this tablet! Highly recommended, especially for a toddler who's learning. Has lots of games and activities for learning, parental controls, which I find extremely necessary for the internet today!","595":"My 5 and 8 year olds love these tablets. They are able to play age appropriate content. Tablet seems well powered and the case is providing good protection.","596":"My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!","597":"My grand children love kids tablets and play with them every day and their mother is using them to teach the kids","598":"My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it's still ticking.","599":"Purchased these for our grandchildren ... great for children learning to use electronics.","600":"Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this","601":"She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school","602":"Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty.","603":"Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.","604":"The kids never put them down, Plenty of apps to keep them interested. Parental locks keep them safe.","605":"This is the fourth one of these that I have purchased. My grand children love them. Between the one year of programming and the two years of warranty, I don't think there is a better tablet on the market for children. Excellent product and it works very well with the children at what ever level they are at.","606":"This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.","607":"bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy","608":"i would not change any thing on it at all it works very good","609":"kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there","610":"my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price","611":"the product is working perfectly and the service was greatThank you","612":"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50\/50.","613":"\"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8\"\" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!\"","614":"Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.","615":"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide.","616":"Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all","617":"Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.","618":"Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants","619":"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books.","620":"I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it.","621":"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy.","622":"We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends","623":"works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle","624":"\"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7\"\" Fire Kids Edition","625":"\"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1\/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The \"\"buttons\"\" are better than the old one. I like that is has more \"\"perks\"\"","626":"\"The 8\"\" version is much better than the older 7\"\" version. Better graphics and faster processor\"","627":"Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it","628":"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used\/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it.","629":"Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!!","630":"Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices.","631":"Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting","632":"Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend.","633":"Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it!","634":"Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.","635":"Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it","636":"Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.","637":"Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.","638":"Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but","639":"For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet","640":"Good and smooth speed. Long battery with quick charge","641":"Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it.","642":"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and\/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?","643":"Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems","644":"Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.","645":"Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase!","646":"I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it.","647":"I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I 've had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon.","648":"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price.","649":"I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content.","650":"I got this mainly to watch tv\/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date.","651":"I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price.","652":"I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.","653":"I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed.","654":"It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.","655":"Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books.","656":"Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance.","657":"My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him.","658":"My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one.","659":"Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs!","660":"Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!","661":"Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop.","662":"Tablet was college student. Replace a bulky laptop. Good for taking notes, reading text books and regular books. Loud alarm to wake college student for early classes. All a round got tool for school.","663":"Thank..............................................","664":"The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it's fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it).","665":"This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!","666":"This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.","667":"This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.","668":"This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we've made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice!","669":"This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!","670":"does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms.","671":"needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us","672":"perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in","673":"this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera","674":"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.","675":"Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader.","676":"BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.","677":"\"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\"\" wide by 5.5\"\" tall. In fact","678":"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book.","679":"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle.","680":"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough.","681":"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is.","682":"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.","683":"Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking","684":"This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading -","685":"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have.","686":"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.","687":"There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.","688":"I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did.","689":"The kindle has a wide variety of ebooks that I thouroughly enjoyed taking on my adventures.","690":"Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product.","691":"I love to read but don't have the space to keep a collection of books. For me, this Kindle is the best of both worlds. I can enjoy reading a good book without having to find shelf space to store it later.","692":"I loved this Kindle which is even better. It's a gift to a very important friend. Now he is unable to hold a book open with. He says that is easy to read but even lighter is wonderful.","693":"I originally got the lower end Kindle, took it back and upgraded. The light really is a must. I can't believe how much more I'm reading now that I have it, and there are TONS of free books out there if you know where to look. Best. Purchase. EVER.","694":"Love to rad my books with my kindle and download straight from my device. So easy and safe. Lovit. Thanks Best Buy","695":"Very nice and easy to use. I bought 2 of these for my granddaughters and they both love them!! Great price, great product!","696":"This was purchased as a replacement for an aging third party e-reader. It is light weight, compact, easy on the eyes while reading and has a long battery life. The Kindle library has a wide variety of books, many of which are free. The one draw back for some people may be that the lock-screen has ads. This is only on the lock-screen, the ads don't appear while using the device and Amazon can permanently remove the ads for a fee.","697":"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!","698":"Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.","699":"Killer tablet for the price. No issues running any apps or programs.","700":"My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!","701":"Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor.","702":"Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.","703":"Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player.","704":"Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol","705":"Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs.","706":"I believe this' a great item, my sister has 1 and we liked it that's what prompt us to get one","707":"I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase.","708":"This product was easy to set up and to use.

It is the best tablet for reading books or listening to audiobooks.","714":"Excellent price for a tablet. Hit for my daughter, she loves it!","715":"Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.","716":"I purchased this tablet as a Christmas gift for my niece and she loves it","717":"I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line.

It's very easy to use...","721":"bought this kindle for my grandson, he loves it and it very easy to use","722":"features are similar to my fire 6 and this upgrade is good. I wish it was lighter in weight, although I enjoy the larger screen.","723":"screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet","724":"I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet","725":"Very happy with the HD Fire 16GB. Plenty of memory and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this item.","726":"I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more.

They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!","730":"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK","731":"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!","732":"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it.","733":"Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it","734":"My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.","735":"Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.","736":"Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.","737":"great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all.","738":"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!","739":"Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.","740":"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games.","741":"This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.","742":"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward.","743":"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books.","744":"Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books.","745":"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price.","746":"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls\/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.","747":"Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far.","748":"Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use.","749":"Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned....","750":"Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product.","751":"I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.","752":"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names.","753":"I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use","754":"I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use.","755":"I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device.","756":"I love the fact that is very practical and I didn't have to spend a lot of money.","757":"I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations","758":"Mom loves the tablet. Easy for her to use, she uses it for Facebook, reading, and some of her games.","759":"On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!","760":"This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great","761":"We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.","762":"this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school","763":"works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos","764":"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging","765":"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad.","766":"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet.","767":"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon.","768":"\"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an \"\"Android like\"\" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading.\"","769":"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others.","770":"Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.","771":"\"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with \"\"Silk\"\" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in.\"","772":"Good product.

She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it","775":"I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it.","776":"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS.","777":"It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.","778":"My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which.","779":"My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.","780":"Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.","781":"The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well.","782":"The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.","783":"The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice.","784":"\"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\"\" for the screen size","785":"\"I bought the 8\"\" to replace my old 7\"\". I love the bigger screen\"","786":"\"My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7\"\" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more","787":"Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.","788":"Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service.

Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps.","799":"Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN!","800":"Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use \/ loose. Really a plus for travel.

I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.","814":"I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference.

Screen protectors would make the sensitivity too difficult for her to use and I couldn't ever find a good drop-proof protective case.I finally discovered the Amazon Fire Kids edition and wish I had known of this 3 broken tablets ago. Aside from the awesome drop-proof case, it has a nicely done custom kids view that removes all the things I don't want my daughter having access to (Youtube, the Google play store, web browsing). I already had one issue with it (99% certain it was my fault) but Amazon's \"\"Worry Free Guarantee\"\" had me a replacement tablet in 2 days for zero cost and no questions asked. If you have a young child you want to get a tablet for","846":"Bought this tablet for my 2 year old and she loves it. No more using mami\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s IPhone.

The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine.","859":"It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4sadvertisement Everything on your scree but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 very cheap.","860":"I returned this item because I couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t get a keyboard with a case to go with it.","861":"Not a good tablet for kids.

My niece was very happy","864":"Great product I got it to stream you tube from device to my tv","865":"I had an older Kindle Fire and thought the transition to this one would be smooth. I was even encouraged to turn in my old one one the spot. After cleaning up the old one and saving the old files on the cloud I thought....I bought this updated version to find that it does not recognize the old files....so much for it being saved on the cloud. Then instead of it having an ad whenever I turn it on....ads also clutter the screen with the apps. I was happier with the older model and regret turning it in for a credit....which somehow dropped $10 in value in the time it took me to prep it before I deregistered it. If you didn't have an older model you probably will be happy with this one.","866":"I purchased this tablet during the black Friday deals and for the price it is a pretty decent tablet.

It really is a personal assistant, new skills are appearing every day and It's fun finding new things she can do and answer. Ever expanding knowledge base and skills are the biggest feature, not likely to become obsolete very soon .....","889":"Only download was very slow and echo show didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t make it worth having as a stand alone","890":"A great addition to our home.

However the down sides are it has a great speaker so if it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s full max it may be hard for Alexa to hear you. Another downside google hates amazon = not YouTube.","898":"I love the echo show! The only thing I dislike is it doesn't play YouTube videos. Not a deal breaker though.","899":"I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home","900":"Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices.","901":"Love the Alexa A.I. Better than apple and google versions. The screen gives even more points because you can see all of Alexa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s responses as well as video call. Awesome","902":"The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s compatible with my mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Arlo Security cameras. It works great!","903":"Was so excited to get this!!! It is so much fun to use.","904":"We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It's in our kitchen and we use it everyday!","905":"I had the Echo previously, but having the screen opens up more options for Alexa. I find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather. I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds. While the unit is kind of large, it is stable and supports touch. I haven't tried video calling or playing videos, but the screen quality seems pretty good.","906":"Awesome so far. Have used it as alarm clock, stereo, 2nd screen for movies (while multitasking on PC), news\/weather, audiobooks, and more. The news flash can repeat itself at times, but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories, but a quick alexa - next skips right ahead. Still learning the variations of commands, and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar. tic. u. late. to the point of annoyance, but hey, this is still relatively new tech, and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago","907":"I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE","908":"I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible.","909":"The first thing we noticed was Alexa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.","910":"When I tried to hook it up it wouldn't recognize my internet. I will have to contact best buy when I get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working","911":"Have just started using Alexa and am looking forward to all the other things that are available to use with the unit","912":"Can not tell you the price of merchandise when asked.","913":"Pretty fun little gadget. Kids love playing with it. Not even sure of all the things it can do yet","914":"Sound and response is good. Works well for area coverage.","915":"\"Bought eh Echo Plus on a whim - it was on sale and I figured, \"\"why not.\"\" I am really enjoying it. Apart form the basic news and weather reporting","916":"A perfect gift for someone who has everything and a busy schedule","917":"Echo Plus has everything the old Echo had, plus better sound and built-in capability for Smart Home add-ons, like Hue bulbs and SmartThings plugs \u201a\u00c4\u00ee without needing a Hue hub or ST hub. Love it!","918":"Eco plus is an amazing product, it integrates with most of the products...U can set the music, reminders, buy products.. what not...definitely a worthy purchase!!!","919":"I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s.","920":"I love Alexa...She has become my best friend. Thanks","921":"I love our Amazon echo plus! My boyfriend says this was the best present for Christmas. daily.","922":"I need to buy all the additional parts but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s great","923":"It has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo","924":"This Echo has great sound for such a a small device. It is easy to set up and use. I am finding new tasks Alexa can do each day.","925":"This is a neat little toy. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pretty cool that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m able to turn the lights on and off, by talking to Alexa.","926":"This is our first Echo so nothing to compare it to, but so far so good! Sound is great. Fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly!","927":"works like a dream.use it daily.phone feature is really cool.like it.","928":"I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m pretty impressed with the technology. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a little annoying having to say Alexa all the time. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve purchases the links for the outlets and that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s all it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really good for since the bulbs were too dim for me.","929":"Alexa walks you through every step which I found helpful.","930":"I bought it for my grandson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s birthday... he loves it;)","931":"My 11year old daughter is loving this ereader. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s light and portable so she brings it in the car on trips. She also loves to use it in the bathtub as she takes her long relaxing baths. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s great so far."},"reviewer":{"0":"Person","1":"Bot","2":"userBot","3":"Person","4":"userBot","5":"userBot","6":"Bot","7":"Bot","8":"userBot","9":"userBot","10":"Bot","11":"Bot","12":"userBot","13":"Bot","14":"reviewBot","15":"Person","16":"Bot","17":"reviewBot","18":"Person","19":"reviewBot","20":"reviewBot","21":"userBot","22":"Bot","23":"Bot","24":"reviewBot","25":"userBot","26":"Person","27":"Bot","28":"Bot","29":"userBot","30":"Person","31":"userBot","32":"userBot","33":"userBot","34":"Person","35":"Bot","36":"reviewBot","37":"reviewBot","38":"Bot","39":"Bot","40":"reviewBot","41":"Person","42":"Person","43":"Bot","44":"reviewBot","45":"Bot","46":"Bot","47":"Bot","48":"Bot","49":"Bot","50":"Bot","51":"Bot","52":"Bot","53":"reviewBot","54":"Person","55":"Person","56":"Bot","57":"reviewBot","58":"Bot","59":"Person","60":"reviewBot","61":"Bot","62":"Person","63":"Bot","64":"Person","65":"Bot","66":"Person","67":"Person","68":"Person","69":"Bot","70":"Bot","71":"Person","72":"Bot","73":"Bot","74":"Person","75":"Person","76":"Person","77":"Bot","78":"userBot","79":"userBot","80":"Bot","81":"Person","82":"reviewBot","83":"userBot","84":"Person","85":"Bot","86":"Person","87":"userBot","88":"Person","89":"Person","90":"Person","91":"Bot","92":"Person","93":"Bot","94":"Bot","95":"userBot","96":"Bot","97":"Bot","98":"Bot","99":"Bot","100":"Bot","101":"Bot","102":"Bot","103":"Person","104":"userBot","105":"Bot","106":"Bot","107":"Bot","108":"Bot","109":"Bot","110":"Bot","111":"Bot","112":"Bot","113":"Bot","114":"Bot","115":"reviewBot","116":"Bot","117":"reviewBot","118":"reviewBot","119":"Bot","120":"userBot","121":"reviewBot","122":"Bot","123":"Person","124":"Person","125":"Person","126":"Person","127":"Person","128":"Bot","129":"userBot","130":"Bot","131":"Person","132":"Bot","133":"Person","134":"userBot","135":"Person","136":"Person","137":"Person","138":"Person","139":"Person","140":"Person","141":"Bot","142":"Bot","143":"Bot","144":"Bot","145":"Bot","146":"Person","147":"Person","148":"Person","149":"userBot","150":"Person","151":"userBot","152":"Bot","153":"Bot","154":"userBot","155":"Bot","156":"Bot","157":"Bot","158":"Bot","159":"userBot","160":"userBot","161":"Bot","162":"Bot","163":"userBot","164":"userBot","165":"Person","166":"Bot","167":"userBot","168":"Bot","169":"Person","170":"Bot","171":"Bot","172":"Bot","173":"userBot","174":"Bot","175":"Bot","176":"Bot","177":"Bot","178":"Bot","179":"Bot","180":"Bot","181":"Bot","182":"Bot","183":"Bot","184":"Bot","185":"userBot","186":"Bot","187":"Bot","188":"Person","189":"Person","190":"Bot","191":"Person","192":"Person","193":"Person","194":"Person","195":"Person","196":"Bot","197":"Person","198":"Person","199":"Person","200":"Person","201":"userBot","202":"Person","203":"userBot","204":"Bot","205":"userBot","206":"Bot","207":"Person","208":"Person","209":"Bot","210":"Person","211":"Person","212":"Person","213":"Person","214":"Bot","215":"Person","216":"reviewBot","217":"reviewBot","218":"Person","219":"Person","220":"reviewBot","221":"userBot","222":"Person","223":"Person","224":"Person","225":"Person","226":"Person","227":"Person","228":"Person","229":"Person","230":"userBot","231":"userBot","232":"Person","233":"Bot","234":"Person","235":"Person","236":"Person","237":"Person","238":"Person","239":"userBot","240":"userBot","241":"Person","242":"Bot","243":"Person","244":"Bot","245":"userBot","246":"Person","247":"Person","248":"Person","249":"Bot","250":"Person","251":"Bot","252":"Person","253":"Bot","254":"Bot","255":"Bot","256":"Person","257":"Person","258":"userBot","259":"Person","260":"Person","261":"reviewBot","262":"Person","263":"Person","264":"userBot","265":"Bot","266":"Person","267":"Bot","268":"Bot","269":"Person","270":"userBot","271":"Person","272":"Bot","273":"Person","274":"Person","275":"reviewBot","276":"Person","277":"Bot","278":"Person","279":"reviewBot","280":"userBot","281":"Bot","282":"Person","283":"Bot","284":"Person","285":"Bot","286":"Person","287":"Person","288":"Bot","289":"Bot","290":"Person","291":"userBot","292":"reviewBot","293":"Person","294":"Bot","295":"Bot","296":"reviewBot","297":"Person","298":"Person","299":"Person","300":"userBot","301":"Person","302":"userBot","303":"userBot","304":"Person","305":"Bot","306":"Person","307":"Person","308":"Bot","309":"Person","310":"Bot","311":"Bot","312":"Bot","313":"Person","314":"Person","315":"Person","316":"Bot","317":"Person","318":"Person","319":"Person","320":"Person","321":"userBot","322":"Person","323":"userBot","324":"Bot","325":"Person","326":"Person","327":"Person","328":"Person","329":"Person","330":"userBot","331":"Person","332":"userBot","333":"Person","334":"Person","335":"Bot","336":"Bot","337":"Person","338":"Person","339":"Person","340":"Person","341":"Person","342":"Person","343":"userBot","344":"Person","345":"userBot","346":"Person","347":"Person","348":"Bot","349":"Person","350":"Person","351":"Person","352":"Person","353":"userBot","354":"userBot","355":"Bot","356":"
